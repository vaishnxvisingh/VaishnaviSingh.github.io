<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I am Vaishnavi Singh, a B.Tech Computer Science Engineering (AI/ML) student at Graphic Era Hill University, Dehradun. 
I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and building efficient software systems that solve
real-world problems. Currently, I am working on an E-Library System as part of my Design and Analysis of Algorithms coursework, 
focusing on optimizing search and data management techniques. I am also developing a Deep Learning model for
Fake Certificate Detection,where I apply CNN architectures to verify document authenticity through image-based analysis.
I enjoy learning new technologies, strengthening my problem-solving skills, and applying theoretical 
concepts to practical implementations. My goal is to build intelligent, scalable systems that create real impact.

<h3>Learnings in Lab 1</h3>
<p>Lab 1 – Presentation Skills Development
In the first lab session, I learned essential presentation skills, including effective
speaking techniques, confidence building, audience engagement, and the importance of
professional appearance and dressing appropriately for formal presentations. This session
helped me understand how communication style and body language significantly influence the
impact of a presentation.</p>

<h3>Learnings in Lab 2</h3>
<p>Lab 1 – Presentation Skills Development
During the second lab, my group and I delivered a presentation on the topic of UCC, where
I gained experience in teamwork, content organization, and collaborative presentation delivery.
